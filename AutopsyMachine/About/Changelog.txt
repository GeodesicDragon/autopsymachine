Version 1.1.4 (May 1st 2022)

* Increased power consumption of the autopsy machine to 1000W (was 400).
* The autopsy machine now provides meat and leather after finishing its task.
	* This was achieved by a patch which slightly tweaked the RecipeDefs of the autopsy table. So, if you were to perform an autopsy at said table, you'd also get meat and leather. I couldn't think of any other way to get it working.
* The autopsy machine can now be overclocked to increase working speed and range.
	* Increasing speed (by 1 to 3) uses an extra 250W of power per step.
	* Increasing range (by 1 to 4) uses an extra 200W of power per step.
* Edited name of mod (seen in mod list).
