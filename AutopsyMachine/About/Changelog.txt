Version 2.0.7 (May 19th 2022)

* Fixed missing load order check for Extended Bioengineering for VFE Insectoids.
* Building an autopsy machine no longer requires research.
* Building an autopsy machine no longer requires steel.
* Building an autopsy machine now requires 4 robotic arms (was 2).
* The autopsy machine's work speed can now be overclocked up to 4 times (was 3).
* The autopsy machine's base work speed has been increased to 2.5 (was 2).
* The autopsy machine now has an equivalent Medical skill of 20 (was 15). This should ensure that it can perform all imported bills.

Version 2.0.0 (May 9th 2022)

* The mod no longer explicitly requires Harvest Organs Post Mortem, and will instead import recipes from mods that have some kind of autopsy recipe. As of this update, the following mods are supported:
	* Harvest Organs Post Mortem
	* AutopsyTable (Continued)
	* Extended Bioengineering for VFE Insectoids (only the dissection recipe)

Version 1.1.8 (May 7th 2022)

* Updated description to remove joke reference to (my) previous bad art.
* Building an autopsy machine can now be done after researching basic autopsies.

Version 1.1.6 (May 7th 2022)

* The autopsy machine now has a shiny new texture, courtesy of JuryOfYourFears.
	* Has two different textures: one for when the machine is idle, and one for when it is working.
* Reduced the amount of steel needed to build an autopsy machine to 50 (was 100).

Version 1.1.4 (May 1st 2022)

* Increased power consumption of the autopsy machine to 1000W (was 400).
* The autopsy machine now provides meat and leather after finishing its task.
	* This was achieved by a patch which slightly tweaked the RecipeDefs of the autopsy table. So, if you were to perform an autopsy at said table, you'd also get meat and leather. I couldn't think of any other way to get it working.
* The autopsy machine can now be overclocked to increase working speed and range.
	* Increasing speed (by 1 to 3) uses an extra 250W of power per step.
	* Increasing range (by 1 to 4) uses an extra 200W of power per step.
* Edited name of mod (seen in mod list).

Version 1.0.1 (May 1st 2022)
