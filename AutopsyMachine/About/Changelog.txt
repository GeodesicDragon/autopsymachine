Version 2.0.0 (May 9th 2022)

* The mod no longer explicitly requires Harvest Organs Post Mortem, and will instead import recipes from mods that have some kind of autopsy recipe. As of this update, the following mods are supported:
	* Harvest Organs Post Mortem
	* AutopsyTable (Continued)
	* Extended Bioengineering for VFE Insectoids (only the dissection recipe)

Version 1.1.8 (May 7th 2022)

* Updated description to remove joke reference to (my) previous bad art.
* Building an autopsy machine can now be done after researching basic autopsies.

Version 1.1.6 (May 7th 2022)

* The autopsy machine now has a shiny new texture, courtesy of JuryOfYourFears.
	* Has two different textures: one for when the machine is idle, and one for when it is working.
* Reduced the amount of steel needed to build an autopsy machine to 50 (was 100).

Version 1.1.4 (May 1st 2022)

* Increased power consumption of the autopsy machine to 1000W (was 400).
* The autopsy machine now provides meat and leather after finishing its task.
	* This was achieved by a patch which slightly tweaked the RecipeDefs of the autopsy table. So, if you were to perform an autopsy at said table, you'd also get meat and leather. I couldn't think of any other way to get it working.
* The autopsy machine can now be overclocked to increase working speed and range.
	* Increasing speed (by 1 to 3) uses an extra 250W of power per step.
	* Increasing range (by 1 to 4) uses an extra 200W of power per step.
* Edited name of mod (seen in mod list).
